abstract={Educational games aim to balance learning and playing. However, for people to benefit from an educational game, they must be encouraged to play the game often. Providing players with information about how to improve their performance could help in achieving this goal. This paper examines how a learning analytics dashboard can be incorporated into an educational game to encourage players to play more often and continuously. The proposed dashboard provides players with a variety of information such as how their performance and skills change over time. Such information allows players to see their performance and play habits, and find strategies on how to improve their performance, and therefore their learning, in the game. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents LISSA ("Learning dashboard for Insights and Support during Study Advice"), a learning analytics dashboard designed, developed, and evaluated in collaboration with study advisers. The overall objective is to facilitate communication between study advisers and students by visualizing grade data that is commonly available in any institution. More specifically, the dashboard attempts to support the dialogue between adviser and student through an overview of study progress, peer comparison, and by triggering insights based on facts as a starting point for discussion and argumentation. We report on the iterative design process and evaluation results of a deployment in 97 advising sessions. We have found that the dashboard supports the current adviser-student dialogue, helps them motivate students, triggers conversation, and provides tools to add personalization, depth, and nuance to the advising session. It provides insights at a factual, interpretative, and reflective level and allows both adviser and student to take an active role during the session. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an evaluation of a learning dashboard that supports the dialogue between a student and a study advisor. The dashboard was designed, developed, and evaluated in collaboration with study advisers. To ensure scalability to other contexts, the dashboard uses data that is commonly available at any higher education institute. It visualizes the grades of the student, an overview of the progress through the year, his/her position in comparison with peers, sliders to plan the next years and a prediction of the length of the bachelor program for this student in years based on historic data. The dashboard was deployed at KU Leuven, Belgium and used in September 2017 to support 224 sessions between students and study advisers. We observed twenty of these conversations. We also collected feedback from 101 students with questionnaires. Results of our observations indicate that the dashboard primarily triggers insights at the beginning of a conversation. The number of insights and the level of these insights (factual, interpretative and reflective) depends on the context of the conversation. Most insights were triggered in conversations with students doubting to continue the program, indicating that our dashboard is useful to support difficult decision-making processes. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has caused a major impact on online education. However, learning analytics support for MOOCs still needs to improve to fulfill requirements of instructors and students. In addition, MOOCs pose challenges for learning analytics tools due to the number of learners, such as scalability in terms of computing time and visualizations. In this work, we present different visualizations of our 'Add-on of the learNing AnaLYtics Support for open Edx' (ANALYSE), which is a learning analytics tool that we have designed and implemented for Open edX, based on MOOC features, teacher feedback, and pedagogical foundations. In addition, we provide a technical solution that addresses scalability at two levels: first, in terms of performance scalability, where we propose an architecture for handling massive amounts of data within educational settings; and, second, regarding the representation of visualizations under massiveness conditions, as well as advice on color usage and plot types. Finally, we provide some examples on how to use these visualizations to evaluate student performance and detect problems in resources. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Many universities choose the C programming language (C) as the first one they teach their students, early on in their program. However, students often consider programming courses difficult, and these courses often have among the highest dropout rates of computer science courses offered. It is therefore critical to provide more effective instruction to help students understand the syntax of C and prevent them losing interest in programming. In addition, homework and paper-based exams are still the main assessment methods in the majority of classrooms. It is difficult for teachers to grasp students' learning situation due to the large amount of evaluation work. To facilitate teaching and learning of C, in this article we propose a system-LAPLE (Learning Analytics in Programming Language Education)-that provides a learning dashboard to capture the behavior of students in the classroom and identify the different difficulties faced by different students looking at different knowledge. With LAPLE, teachers may better grasp students' learning situation in real time and better improve educational materials using analysis results. For their part, novice undergraduate programmers may use LAPLE to locate syntax errors in C and get recommendations from educational materials on how to fix them. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of research on learning dashboards in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. Research on learning dashboards aims to identify what data is meaningful to different stakeholders and how data can be presented to support sense-making processes. Learning dashboards are becoming popular due to the increased use of educational technologies, such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The initial search of five main academic databases and GScholar resulted in 346 papers out of which 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as various aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity regarding evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, most studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. The review concludes by offering a definition for learning dashboards and by outlining open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards. There is a need for longitudinal research in authentic settings and studies that systematically compare different dashboard designs. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Existing tools aim to detect university students with early diagnosis of dyslexia or reading difficulties, but there are not developed tools that let those students better understand some aspects of their difficulties. In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronym for the Spanish name Panel de Analíticas de Aprendizaje de Dislexia en Adultos), is presented. PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learner model. Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help them to increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help them to understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, as well as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process. Implications for the design of learning analytics are discussed and directions for future work are outlined. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Learning Analytics (LA) dashboards help raise student and teacher awareness regarding learner activities. In blog-supported and inquiry-based learning courses, LA data is not limited to student activities, but also contains an abundance of digital learner artefacts, such as blog posts, hypotheses, and mind-maps. Exploring peer activities and artefacts can help students gain new insights and perspectives on learning efforts and outcomes, but requires effort. To help facilitate and promote this exploration, we present the lessons learnt during and guidelines derived from the design, deployment and evaluation of five dashboards. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Adding uncertainty information to visualizations is becoming increasingly common across domains since its addition helps ensure that informed decisions are made. This work has shown the difficulty that is inherent to representing uncertainty. Moreover, the representation of uncertainty has yet to be thoroughly explored in educational domains even though visualizations are often used in educational reporting. We analyzed 50 uncertainty-augmented visualizations from various disciplines to map out how uncertainty has been represented. We then analyzed 106 visualizations from educational reporting systems where the learner can see the visualization; these visualizations provide learners with information about several factors including their knowledge, performance, and abilities. This analysis mapped the design space that has been employed to communicate a learner's abilities, knowledge, and interests. It also revealed several opportunities for the inclusion of uncertainty information within visualizations of educational data. We describe how uncertainty information can be added to visualizations of educational data and illustrate these opportunities by augmenting several of the types of visualizations that are found in existing learning analytics reports. The definition of this design space, based on a survey of the literature, will enable the systematic exploration of how different design decisions affect learner trust, understanding, and decision making. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Learning Analytics is about collecting traces that learners leave behind and using those traces to improve learning. Dashboard applications can visualize these traces to present learners and teachers with useful information. The work in this paper is based on traces from an inquiry-based learning (IBL) environment, where learners create hypotheses, discuss findings and collect data in the field using mobile devices. We present a work-in-progress that enables teachers and learners to gather around an interactive tabletop to explore the abundance of learning traces an IBL environment generates, and help collaboratively make sense of them, so as to facilitate insights.},

abstract={This paper introduces LARAe (Learning Analytics Reflection & Awareness environment), a teacher-oriented dashboard that visualizes learning traces from students, badges and course content. We also present an evaluation of the dashboard in a course on Human-Computer Interaction. The LARAe teacher dashboard provides a detailed overview of group and individual activities, achievements and course outcomes. To help visualize the abundance of traces, badges are used to abstract essential aspects of the course such as course goals and social activity. This paper reports our work on LARAe, presents the course in which we evaluated our approach with students and teachers, and analyses our first results that indicate that such an environment can help with teacher awareness. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={In this paper, we present work on learning analytics that aims to support learners and teachers through dashboard applications, ranging from small mobile applications to learnscapes on large public displays. Dashboards typically capture and visualize traces of learning activities, in order to promote awareness, reflection, and sense-making, and to enable learners to define goals and track progress toward these goals. Based on an analysis of our own work and a broad range of similar learning dashboards, we identify HCI issues for this exciting research area. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={In this article, we introduce the results of a study concerning the usefulness of five educational data visualizations implemented in an online course. Information about the teachers' and students' opinions on the usefulness of the visualizations was collected by using a web survey and the focus group method. To ensure that the visualizations are in used correctly during the course, their use was also tracked by using a web analytics platform. Well-designed and usable visual analytic tools and visualizations can help teachers make decisions regarding potential pedagogical strategies, instructional guidance, actions, and interventions that may be used to promote and support students' participation and activity. According to the results of this research, most of the students seemed to prefer visualizations that offer concrete and practical support for their studies rather than visualizations that support them in monitoring and evaluating their own learning performance. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The 'immediacy' of feedback on academic performance is a common characteristic shared by both Learning Analytics (LA) and Formative Assessment (FA), and such immediacy could be facilitated by supporting the mobility of learners. However, there is little literature that investigates the significance of combining these two techniques. Therefore, this paper will discuss the analytical application called Quiz My Class Understanding (QMCU) which was purposely developed to investigate the significance of the combination between LA and FA techniques in order to provide students with immediate detailed feedback. Furthermore, it reports on a case study which reflects the role QMCU students' centered mobile dashboard in increasing the students' engagement with the QMCU dashboard. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel approach to build and deploy learning analytics dashboards in multiple learning environments. Existing learning dashboards are barely portable: once deployed on a learning platform, it requires considerable effort to deploy the dashboard elsewhere. We suggest constructing dashboards from lightweight web applications, namely widgets. Our approach allows to port dashboards with no additional cost between learning environments that implement open specifications (Open Social and Activity Streams) for data access and use widget APIs. We propose to facilitate reuse by sharing the dashboards and widgets via a centralized analytics repository. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This article introduces learning analytics dashboards that visualize learning traces for learners and teachers. We present a conceptual framework that helps to analyze learning analytics applications for these kinds of users. We then present our own work in this area and compare with 15 related dashboard applications for learning. Most evaluations evaluate only part of our conceptual framework and do not assess whether dashboards contribute to behavior change or new understanding, probably also because such assessment requires longitudinal studies. © 2013 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Never before in history has data been generated at such high volumes as it is today. Exploring and analyzing the vast volumes of data is becoming increasingly difficult. Information visualization and visual data mining can help to deal with the flood of information. The advantage of visual data exploration is that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. There are a large number of information visualization techniques which have been developed over the last decade to support the exploration of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a classification of information visualization and visual data mining techniques which is based on the data type to be visualized, the visualization technique, and the interaction and distortion technique. We exemplify the classification using a few examples, most of them referring to techniques and systems presented in this special section.},
